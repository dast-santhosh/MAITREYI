## 📖 What is Maitreyi?

**Maitreyi** is not just a chatbot; it is a reimagining of the traditional Indian classroom experience using cutting-edge Generative AI. 

Designed by **Sandy Softwares (Santhosh)**, this app ensures that high-quality, interactive, and emotionally resonant tutoring is available to anyone with an internet connection. It bridges the gap between raw information and deep understanding through sight, sound, and emotional connection.

## ❤️ The "Soul": The Persona

Unlike generic AI assistants that sound robotic, Maitreyi possesses a distinct, warm personality:

* **👩‍🏫 The "Mam" Persona:** She acts as an emotional, caring, and passionate Indian school teacher.
* **🗣️ Local Connection:** She speaks the language of the student. Whether it's **Hinglish** (Hindi + English) or **Tanglish** (Tamil + English), she uses familiar phrases like *"Dekho beta"* (Look here, child) or *"Purinjidha?"* (Understood?) to build rapport.
* **🎙️ The Voice:** Utilizing Indian-accented Text-to-Speech, the auditory experience feels familiar, homegrown, and comforting.

## 🧠 The "Brain": The Technology

Maitreyi is a marvel of client-side engineering, powered by Google's most advanced models.

* **⚡ Powered by DeepMind:** The core logic runs on DeepMind.
* **🎨 Multimodal Logic:** It doesn't just output text. It "thinks" in educational steps:
    * Writes explanations on the board (HTML/SVG).
    * Creates **Hand-Drawn Diagrams** or **Realistic Images** on the fly (Gemini Image Generation).
* **🌐 Serverless Architecture:** The entire app runs in your browser using **React + Vite**. It communicates directly with Google's API, ensuring privacy and speed without heavy backend infrastructure.

## 🚀 The "Experience": Key Features

### 1. The Blackboard UI
A nostalgic, dark-textured interface where text appears in neon chalk colors (Pink, Yellow, Cyan). It brings the feel of a physical classroom to the digital screen.

### 2. Dynamic Visuals
The lesson flow strictly alternates between Text and Images to maintain engagement.
> *Example:* You see a definition of a rocket ➡️ followed immediately by a generated image of a rocket launching.

### 3. Karaoke Subtitles
As "Mam" speaks, the subtitles highlight word-by-word (or clause-by-clause), mimicking a real-time lecture and aiding in reading comprehension.

### 4. Deep Interactivity
* **Zoom & Rotate:** Interact with generated diagrams.
* **Sticky Notes:** Click on specific terms to generate instant, deep-dive definitions without leaving the flow of the lesson.
